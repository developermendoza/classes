    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, classes are a way to define objects and their behavior,
      making it easier to create and manage object-oriented code. Classes were
      introduced in <b>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</b> to provide a more structured and
      syntactically familiar way to create constructor functions and
      prototype-based inheritance
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Class-based inheritance</b> in JavaScript can be achieved by extending
      classes. The <b>"super" keyword</b> is used to call the constructor of the
      parent class. This allow us to reuse the properties and methods from the
      parent class while added new properties and methods.
